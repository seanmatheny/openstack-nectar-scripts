		<b><font size="+2">Welcome to the NeCTAR Research Cloud</font></b><br>
    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>Your project trial with NeCTAR is now active, so enjoy having a look around!
	    You will also get an email from NeCTAR with some additional information, but we thought we'd share some UoA-specific information
		that might also be helpful as you get started. 	
		<ul>
			<b>Where are my instances and data stored?</b>
		  	  <li>By default, your instances and all of your data is stored within UoA data centres</li>
		  	  <li>You can make services of yours (like a web portal) open to the world. Please use common sense with respect to security, and reach out if you're not sure-- we'll be happy to help</li>
		    <br>
		    <b>How can I get support?</b>
			  <li>NeCTAR is largely a self-service environment, but we suppport the platform and do our very best to help with anything else.</li><br>
			  To get support:
			  <ul>
			     <li>Click the "lifesaver" ring at the top of the dashboard to create a support ticket</li>
				 <li>Email <a href = "mailto: nectarsupport@auckland.ac.nz">nectarsupport@auckland.ac.nz</a></li>
				 <li>Stop by Hacky Hour at the Strata Postgraduate Cafe in Kate Edgar Commons on Thursdays at 3pm</li>
			  </ul>
			<br>
		    <b>How can I get more resources or use NeCTAR for longer-term?</b>
		      <li>At any point in the trial, you can apply for a full allocation by submitting an allocation request, 
			    right from the dashboard (Allocations tab > New Request). Just do your best filling it out— we can adjust later as needed. 
			    For the use case field, paste in an abstract describing your research in some detail. </li>
		  	  <li>Please include an abstract in your allocation request (in the Research Use Case field), that describes in some detail what you're researching</li>
		      <li>NeCTAR Projects are approved for up to a year. This is renewable.</li>
		      <li>If your application is approved, you'll be asked to take part in a short survey at the end of the year; this is really important
			    to maintaining our funding for NeCTAR.</li>
		      <li>We have many services we can offer you-- just ask and we're happy to have a chat.</li>
			  <br>
			  <br>
		      Example Services:
		      <ul> 
			    <li>Volume storage for your data</li>
			    <li>GPUs (reservable in 3 month blocks at the moment)</li>
			    <li>Advanced self-service networking</li>
			    <li>DNS (assign a host name to your instance)</li>
			    <li>Windows images (ask us)</li>
			    <li>Access to Virtual Labs</li>
	          </ul>
		      <br>
		      <li>NeCTAR gives you a lot of freedom to do manage things yourself, but right now won't be able to access some UoA services, like: Unifiles, 
		         your department shared drive, standard UoA/SSO login, printing, etc. We do offer a more managed VM service that does have access to these features.
			     There's more information about this service here: <a href>https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/#/content/1</a></li>	
		      </ul>

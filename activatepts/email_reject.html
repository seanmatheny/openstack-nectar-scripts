    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>You recently logged in for the first time to the NeCTAR Dashboard-- thanks for your interest! The NeCTAR Research Cloud in New Zealand is typically a service for postgraduate and staff researchers
		at the University of Auckland, which you don't appear to be (at first glance). In case this is incorrect, please reach out to us at
		<a href = "mailto: nectarsupport@auckland.ac.nz">nectarsupport@auckland.ac.nz</a> and we'll get things cleared up.
	<br>
	<br>
		If you are an undergraduate or honours student at UoA, please have your academic supervisor log in and submit an allocation request. 	
	<br>
	<br>
		If you'd like to meet one of our team for more information on Nectar and other research compute services we offer, please fill out a consultation request form here: 
		<a href>https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/#/content/1</a>
	<br>
	<br>
		In the meantime, feel free to have a look around the dashboard, but you will get an error if you try to launch an instance.
	</p>
	<br>
	Thanks,
	<br>
